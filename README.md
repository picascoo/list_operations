# Python List Operations Demo

This project demonstrates basic Python list operations using standard built-in methods. It covers creation, insertion, extension, deletion, sorting, and index retrieval.

## üß† What it Does

The script performs the following:

1. Creates an empty list
2. Appends elements: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`
3. Inserts `15` at the second position
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. Removes the last element from the list
6. Sorts the list in ascending order
7. Prints the index of the value `30`
